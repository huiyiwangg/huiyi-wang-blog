## About Me

Hello! I’m a dynamic professional with a background in technology consulting, research, and business analysis. I have honed my skills in data analysis, agile methodologies, and client engagement through diverse roles at Ernst & Young, Sauder School of Business, and Atrax System. With a Bachelor of International Economics from UBC and proficiency in SQL, Python, and Power BI, I excel in improving operational efficiency and delivering innovative solutions. Fluent in English and Mandarin, with basic proficiency in Cantonese and Japanese, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to drive impactful change. Welcome to my blog, where I share my journey and insights.
